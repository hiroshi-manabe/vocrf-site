# OpenSpritz

OpenSpritz is an extremely crude implementation of [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) in JavaScript.

All credit goes to [Miserlou](http://github.com/miserlou), I just slightly modified his code to allow users to input any text they desire. 

## TODO
* Make a bookmarklet which will Spritzify highlighted text.
* Make a mobile-friendly version
